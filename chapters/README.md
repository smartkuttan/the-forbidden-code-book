Chapters
--------

Each folder mirrors a chapter in the book. Start with `01-seeds-of-creation/` and proceed sequentially.

Template inside each chapter:
- `README.md` — learning goals, how to run, expected output, troubleshooting
- `code/` — runnable scripts or notebooks
- `data/` — minimal synthetic samples or generators (if needed)
