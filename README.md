## Purpose

This repository contains runnable Python code, synthetic datasets, unit tests, and mini-projects that accompany the book.  
The goal: turn the bookâ€™s parable-like narrative (Eden, the serpent in the code, commandments of ethical coding) into **practical, executable exercises** for developers.

---

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **Chapter Labs** â€“ runnable scripts and notebooks mapped to each book chapter  
- **Datasets** â€“ tiny CSV/JSON examples for bias, fairness, and governance labs  
- **Bias & Fairness Tools** â€“ metrics, mitigation, subgroup analysis  
- **Governance Templates** â€“ reproducibility, CI/CD guardrails, audit stubs  
- **Checklists & Patterns** â€“ model cards, risk logs, ethical design prompts  
- **Unit Tests** â€“ pytest coverage to validate examples and exercises

Repository Layout
-----------------
- `chapters/` â€” chapterâ€‘wise folders with code and docs
- `exercises/` â€” Jupyter notebooks (templates + solutions) per chapter
- `projects/` â€” mini sample projects reinforcing key concepts
- `tests/` â€” pytest unit tests validating example outputs
- `datasets/` â€” small CSV/JSON samples used by exercises
- `env/requirements.txt` â€” pinned dependencies for a clean setup
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` â€” CI pipeline running tests on push/PR

Exercises & Code Examples
-------------------------
- Chapter 1: Spot the Forbidden Fruit â€” group approval rates and a risk map.
- Chapter 2: Risk Map â€” visualize likelihood vs impact.
- Chapter 3: Privacy in Paradise â€” consent gate + tokenized storage.
- Chapter 4: Debug the Serpent â€” proxy leakage and subgroup metrics.
- Chapter 5: Make the Black Box Speak â€” SHAP explanations for a tree model.
- Chapter 6: Code the Mirror Test â€” subgroup accuracy check.
- Chapter 7: Build the Watchtower â€” logging + demographic parity audit.
